I have created an application in Visual Studio using the Maui Framework and .Net version 7.
The application runs on Android and IOS as well, its purpose is to calculate employees worked hours and holidays. 
I have used various Microsoft packages such as Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration or Microsoft.Data.Sqlite in order to add features to the code.  The main challenge I have faced while installing the NutGet packages was to find the correct version for my .Net version, therefore, my Microsoft Packages were version 7, although there are newer versions released, it appears that the newer versions crash the code.
The code structure is prebuilt in Visual Studio, however, not all packages are included.
When trying to run the code using the Android Emulators, I have encountered an error due to the laptop configuration.
In order to run the code and debug it, I had to use developer mode on my phone and connect my personal phone to my computer and run It straight on Android.
The code was running, and I was able to add or remove things in real time, even to change the image used on the main page.
I have attached the GitHub link along with the application demonstration video below. 
ChatGPT has been used for guidance, however, in order to shape the code and run it, I have worked by myself. All the ChatGPT code has been referenced.
I have coded mainly in the mainpage.xaml.cs while adding buttons, labels and customising mainpage.xaml.
